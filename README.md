## 📌 About the Project

This is a simple task list application created to practice backend development with **Flask** and basic **HTML** form handling.  
Users can add tasks and remove them by clicking the "Remove" button next to each item.

- Delete existing tasks  
- Simple and clean user interface

## ⚙️ How it Works

- Tasks are stored in a Python list in memory.  
- Each task is shown with a "Remove" button.  
- Clicking "Remove" sends a POST request to delete that specific task by its index.  
- The app redirects back to the main page to show the updated list.
